## NOOOTES

- Genre colors. Each genre of music has it's own color.
- Site Logo/colors for each listing. Figure out where the link is from.
- How many plays/clicks does a track have?
- Comments/discussion or even just a basic chat?
- Tweet, share, etc...

## TODO!

- compact sharing box
- figure out how to play tracks and control or show different iFrames
- moderator accounts, to delete things that either don't belong or other mod stuff
- genres and stuff
- get the track title from the link with JS or something.
- consider adding tokens to the session instead of just the plain user id. Hint: `Phoenix.Token.sign/3` and `Phoenix.Token.verify/3`
- save a track
- favorite a track
- share a track
- color links and various style fixes.
- this.

## Random Thoughts

- Tweet when someone shares a track?
